# Contributions

All contributions to my repositories are welcome and must be made via Github with a pull request following the rules below.

## Conventions

Commits must follow the specification of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it is possible to add the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/vivaxy/vscode-conventional-commits) to facilitate the creation of commits.

A PR must be made with an updated branch with the `main` branch in rebase (and without merge) before requesting a merge, and the merge must be requested in `main`.

Check whether the repository has linting rules or tests to keep them clean and ensure that CI workflows pass (new features in repositories with tests should be accompanied by new tests to ensure that the new feature works properly).

## Security issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repository, please report it to me through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to <this-is-tobi@proton.me>.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Licence

All the repositories I own are distributed under the MIT license by default, unless the repository in question has its own license, in which case the dedicated license applies.
